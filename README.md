In the project directory, you can run:
### `yarn install`
To install all required dependencies.\
*Note*: if yarn is not installed, run `npm install -g yarn` first (or use other methods to install it).\
*The reason for yarn*: NPM has known issues with package hoisting.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Make sure you replace the `origin` in endpoints.ts to http://localhost:3000.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Executes unit tests via Jest.\
Make sure that all required dependencies are installed with yarn and up-to-date.

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
